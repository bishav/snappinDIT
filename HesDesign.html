		<h1>My comments</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Is it necessary to give additional preference for additional click for "Alternate email" ?</li>
			<li>"Example : Firefox X.X" is new. This would mean we will not do any kind of validation check. As we don't have enough space on the left.</li>
			<li>How will the error messages be defined. Will it be same as how we are currently displaying by default?</li>
			<li>The length of the Prechat form will not fit for Mobile devices. Where as the current Production design supports Mobile Screen size.</li>
			<li>Additional comment was not discussed on the Functionality. This is a new Content.</li>
			<li>There is a separation between Site info, IssueType and the bottom Page that is new.</li>
			<li>We dont have cross buttons (x) for each field. This too will be a new ask.</li>
			<li>The design is different from what we currently have in Prod. The Pre-populated details(Name, Email) are in a Text-Box in a disabled mode. This will require additional effort. as our default design does not look like this.</li>
			<li>Phone Number: Is not provided by default in 80% of the accounts. So this also needs to be read-write.</li>
